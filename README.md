# Cryptogrpahy-using-DES-algorithm-in-C
Implemented DES algorithm in C for text message encryption.

DES is implemented in two parts, 1st for encryption and 2nd part is for decryption.

<--Encryption Process-->
User need to enter the key for encryption in key.txt file.
enter the input plain text message to be encrypt in the input.txt file.
Then run the Encrypt.c file using CodeBlocks.

<--Decryption Process-->
User need to use the same key for decryption as well in a key.txt file.
Then user need to give the cipher message in the cipher.txt file.
Then Run the Decrypt.c file using CodeBlocks
